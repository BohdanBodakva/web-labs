Finish your project by creating the last of three cart pages - Checkout & Success pages.
As a bonus, you will learn a very handy and powerful form validation library - Formik.

Requirements:

1) All of the requirements for previous React.js works should be kept.
2) Functionality:
    1. Form: Your form should have at least 5 fields
    2. Form: Every field should have a validation rule (i.e max length / no special characters / only numbers), just required option - is not enough 
    3. Form: You should have at least one field that uses RegEx and at least one field that doesnâ€™t required string value(i.e Phone number)
    4. Form: In the error message you should describe all errors in all fields with clear reason (i.e Email is incorrect, First name is a required field...)
    5. Form: Error message should be a separate React Component
    6. After successful form submit - the user is redirected to final page (Success page)
3) Code style:
  Use Formik & Yup libraries or any functionality related to form validation
