In this work, you have to make a simple presentation part of a website - View Page

For your blocks you must use data from your java/python project class.

Then using JavaScript, you need to implement the following operations on your data (it is up to you to decide which field should be used for each of the operations):

1) Sort of your items option
2) Search option
3) Count total amount of some of the field

Requirements:

1) Responsiveness absolutely not required.
2) Styling is not important at all. Is up to you.
