Description:

Continue work on your React App by adding a page for  your Item (see the link to wireframe of Item page above). Also, now, you have to make all your previous pages (Home & Catalog) more interactive. 

Requirements:

All of the requirements for previous React.js works should be kept.
1. Code style:

    Your items should be stored inside the state or context (your choice) of your page:    
        1) For your state management use useState() inside Functional Component  instead of this.state and Class component        
        2) If you decided to use context, use useContext() hook instead of Context.Consumer
        
2. Functionality (IMPORTANT):
    1. Home page: “View more” button should display more elements on the same page Tip: Elements can be just random paragraph & heading, use your imagination ;)
    2. Catalog page: You should be able to filter your items list, by applying different filters by item's properties (i.e size/color/type)
    3. Catalog page: Search by any text property option should also work
    3. Catalog & Item pages: “View more” action on every item should refer to corresponding Item page, with correct information about item (get the info from your              state/context)
