# lab7

Description:

Continue work on your React App by adding a page with Items list (see the link to wireframe of Catalog page above).
Variants -  (products that you are ‘selling’) the same as for previous works. (see the description to 3rd work)


Requirements:

1. All of the requirements for previous React.js works should be kept.
2. Code style:
    1. Use array.map() method for rendering your items list
    2. Routing (switching between pages) should work now.
    3. All UI elements (buttons / select) should have corresponding React components (PrimaryButton.jsx / Select.jsx  etc.)
3. Functionality (filter / search / view more) is still not required (you have to complete it on next works)
